#IMPORTANT
DO NOT TOUCH THE LEVELONE.js UNTIL WE ARE DONE WITH GAME MECHANICS


# MentalWarz

DON'T USE CANVAS FOR THE LEVEL ONE HTML PAGE. We need to use elements because canvas is all js and we only have one person on javascript.
We will use divs and id's instead of canvas, which will also make our code cleaner. (DO NOT IMPLEMENT CANVAS CODE FROM TESTLEVEL INTO LEVEL ONE)
